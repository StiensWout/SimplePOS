# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Mobile-first, thumb-friendly interface optimized for speed and error prevention. Every screen follows a "big buttons, clear labels, instant feedback" philosophy. The design eliminates cognitive load through progressive disclosureâ€”volunteers only see options relevant to their current task. Visual hierarchy guides users naturally through workflows with color-coded states (green for success, yellow for pending, red for attention needed) and oversized touch targets suitable for stressful, fast-paced environments.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Single-thumb operation**: All primary actions accessible within thumb reach on mobile devices
- **Tap-to-add simplicity**: Menu items added to orders with single taps, quantities adjusted with prominent +/- buttons
- **Visual confirmation**: Every action provides immediate visual and tactile feedback (color changes, brief animations)
- **Undo-friendly**: Prominent "remove item" and "cancel order" options to quickly fix mistakes
- **Role-locked interfaces**: Users only see their role's functions, preventing accidental access to wrong features
- **Status-driven navigation**: Order states (new/in-progress/complete) drive the interface, not complex menus

### Core Screens and Views

- **Login/Role Selection Screen**: Large role buttons (Waiter, Kitchen, Cashier, Admin) with organization branding
- **Waiter Order Entry Screen**: Menu grid with categories, running order sidebar, table number selector
- **Kitchen Display Dashboard**: Queue of incoming orders, drag-to-progress interface, timer displays
- **Cashier Payment Screen**: Order summary, payment method toggles (Cash/Card), change calculator
- **Admin Dashboard**: Event setup, menu management, real-time sales overview, volunteer management
- **Order Status View**: Table-based order tracking showing all active orders and their current state

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The system will meet WCAG AA standards with high contrast ratios (7:1 for critical elements), clear focus indicators, and text alternatives for all non-text content. Font sizes will be larger than typical (minimum 16px base, 20px for buttons) to accommodate varying vision levels among volunteers.

### Branding

Minimal, neutral design system that doesn't compete with organization identity. Optional organization logo placement in header. Clean, professional appearance using a simple color palette: white backgrounds, dark text, blue primary actions, with accent colors for status states. The interface should feel like a natural extension of the organization's event, not a third-party tool.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Full responsive design supporting:
- **Mobile phones** (primary): iOS Safari, Chrome, Android browsers - optimized for 5-7" screens in portrait
- **Tablets**: Kitchen display optimized for 10" landscape orientation
- **Desktop**: Admin functions and setup tasks optimized for larger screens
- **No app installation required**: Pure web application accessible via URL/QR code
