# Checklist Results Report

### Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness**: 92%
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness**: Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase**: Ready
- **Most Critical Gaps**: Minor gaps in integration requirements and operational monitoring details

### Category Analysis

All major categories passed validation with two areas showing partial completion:
- **Technical Guidance** (85%): Missing specific error monitoring setup details
- **Cross-Functional Requirements** (80%): Data migration and backup strategies need elaboration

### Key Strengths

- Clear problem definition with quantified impact (20-30% wait time reduction)
- Well-scoped MVP focusing on core order flow without feature creep
- Comprehensive user stories with testable acceptance criteria
- Strong technical stack selection aligned with requirements
- Excellent consideration of volunteer user needs (ages 16-70, varying tech skills)

### Recommendations for Architecture Phase

1. Define explicit Sentry error monitoring categories and alerting thresholds
2. Document Convex backup and recovery procedures
3. Create data migration tooling for future schema changes
4. Specify load testing scenarios for 30 concurrent user validation
5. Design offline fallback UI states for connectivity issues

### Final Assessment

**PRD Status: READY FOR ARCHITECT**  
The PRD provides comprehensive requirements with clear scope boundaries, detailed user stories, and specific technical constraints. The identified gaps are minor and can be addressed during architecture without blocking development.
