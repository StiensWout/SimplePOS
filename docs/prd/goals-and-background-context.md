### Background Context

Simple POS addresses the critical operational challenges faced by small local organizations (churches, schools, sports clubs) when running fundraising and social events. Currently, these organizations rely on paper tickets, manual calculations, and physical runners between tables and kitchens, resulting in 20-30% longer wait times, 5-10% revenue loss from errors, and hours of post-event reconciliation work. The volunteer-driven nature of these events demands extreme simplicityâ€”volunteers often work only 1-2 events per year and range from teenagers to seniors with varying tech skills.

Existing commercial POS solutions fail this market due to excessive complexity, hardware requirements, and costs that don't align with occasional use. Simple POS reimagines event point-of-sale through a volunteer-first, web-only approach that leverages devices volunteers already carry, requires zero hardware investment, and provides instant onboarding with role-specific interfaces that prevent errors while maintaining professional operations.
