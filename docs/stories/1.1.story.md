# Story 1.1: Project Foundation and Infrastructure

## Status
InProgress

## Important Setup Notes

### Clerk Role Configuration
See `simple-pos/CLERK_ROLES_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on configuring roles in Clerk dashboard. The role system has been implemented with:
- Server action for updating user roles (`app/actions/updateUserRole.ts`)
- Client component for role selection (`app/onboarding/RoleSelector.tsx`)
- Updated onboarding page with interactive role selection

### Vercel Deployment
The application is deployed at: https://simple-pos-stienswout-stienswouts-projects.vercel.app
- All environment variables configured (CLERK, CONVEX)
- Automatic deployments from GitHub main branch enabled
- Authentication pages working (sign-in, sign-up, dashboard, onboarding)

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** the complete project infrastructure with Next.js, Convex, Clerk, and UI components configured,  
**so that** the application has a solid foundation with authentication, real-time data, and consistent styling.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14+ application created with TypeScript configuration in simple-pos subfolder
2. Convex backend integrated with environment variables configured and dev/prod deployments set up
3. Clerk authentication configured with sign-up/sign-in flows and role claims for Admin, Waiter, Kitchen, Cashier
4. shadcn/ui components installed with base theme and Tailwind CSS configured for responsive design
5. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore, ESLint, and Prettier configurations
6. Development and production environment variables properly separated and documented
7. README updated with setup instructions and local development guide
8. Vercel deployment configured with automatic deployments from main branch
9. Basic health check route working at /api/health returning 200 status

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14.2+ with App Router
- **Backend:** Convex 1.26+ for serverless functions
- **Database:** Convex DB with ACID transactions
- **Authentication:** Clerk 6.31+ for multi-tenant auth
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.0+ with utility classes
- **Testing:** Vitest 2.0+ with Testing Library

### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Key tables to create in convex/schema.ts:
- organizations: Multi-tenant isolation
- users: Role-based access (admin, waiter, kitchen, cashier)
- events: Time-bound selling sessions
- menuItems: Products with categories
- orders: Transaction records
- orderItems: Line items for orders
- auditLogs: Change tracking

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Store prices as integers (cents)
- Multi-tenancy: Every query must include organizationId
- Naming: Components in PascalCase, hooks with 'use' prefix
- Environment variables: Validate with process.env

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: `__tests__/` directories
- Unit tests: 60% of testing pyramid
- Use Vitest with @testing-library/react
- Test setup file: test/setup.ts
- Coverage exclusions: node_modules/, .next/, convex/_generated/

### Environment Variables Template
[Source: architecture/gap-requirements.md#INIT-002 to INIT-004]
```env
# Convex
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Vitest Configuration
[Source: architecture/gap-requirements.md#TEST-002]
```typescript
// vitest.config.mts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tsconfigPaths()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: './test/setup.ts',
    globals: true,
    coverage: {
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      exclude: ['node_modules/', 'test/', '.next/', 'convex/_generated/']
    }
  }
})
```

### Technical Constraints
- Node.js version must be 18.17+ or 20.5+ (LTS)
- npm version must be 9.0+
- All components must be React Server Components compatible
- Real-time subscriptions must have < 1 second latency
- Support 30 concurrent users per event

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `__tests__/unit/` for components and hooks
- Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/` for features
- E2E tests: `e2e/` directory in project root

### Testing Standards
- Write tests alongside feature implementation
- Use descriptive test names with 'should' pattern
- Mock external dependencies (Clerk, Convex) in unit tests
- Use data-testid attributes for E2E test selectors

### Testing Frameworks
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- @testing-library/react for component testing
- Playwright for E2E tests (to be configured later)
