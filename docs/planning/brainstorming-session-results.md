### SCAMPER Method - Feature Innovation (20 min)

**Description:** Systematic approach to generate features using Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse

#### Ideas Generated:

**S - SUBSTITUTE:**
24. Simple descriptive names instead of product codes
25. Item categorization by type (Starters, Mains, Drinks, Desserts)
26. Mobile app replaces paper order tickets
27. Kitchen display screen replaces paper tickets in kitchen
28. Order status tracking (new → in progress → ready → complete)
29. Wait time management for timed service
30. Free model replaces traditional licensing

**C - COMBINE:**
31. Table management + Order tracking = unified view
32. QR code per table for customer order status viewing
33. Customer scans QR to see their table's order progress
34. Real-time status updates visible to customers (no ordering)
35. Transparency for customers without giving control

**A - ADAPT:**
36. Traditional restaurant flow - seat, order, serve, pay
37. Waiter takes order on mobile device at table
38. Orders go directly to kitchen display
39. Table-based tabs that accumulate throughout service
40. Pay at end of meal experience
41. Course-based serving (starters first, then mains)

**M - MODIFY/MAGNIFY:**
(No specific modifications identified at this time)

**P - PUT TO OTHER USES:**
(No additional uses identified at this time)

**E - ELIMINATE:**
42. Remove all hardware dependencies (no special equipment needed)
43. Everything runs server-side with web UIs
44. No local software installation required
45. Works on any device with a browser
46. No receipt printers, cash drawers, or card readers required
47. Cloud-based system accessible from anywhere

**R - REVERSE/REARRANGE:**
48. QR code shows only current table's orders (privacy maintained)
49. Price changes restricted to admin role only
50. Role-based UI profiles (admin, waiter, kitchen, cashier)
51. Different interfaces based on user role/permissions
52. Dish customization with add-ons (sauces, sides, extras)
53. Modular item composition (base item + optional additions)

#### Insights from SCAMPER:
- Web-only approach removes all barriers to entry
- Role-based access creates appropriate complexity levels
- Modular menu items allow flexibility without confusion
- Privacy and permissions are key for multi-user system

### "What If" Scenarios - Edge Cases & Opportunities (15 min)

**Description:** Exploring provocative scenarios to uncover hidden opportunities and challenges

#### Ideas Generated:

**Scenario 1 - The Chaos Test:**
54. System designed for ~30 concurrent users (realistic for local events)
55. No need for complex scaling infrastructure
56. Focus on smooth experience for moderate load

**Scenario 2 - The Volunteer Problem:**
57. Soft delete for orders (recoverable)
58. Undo functionality for recent actions
59. Permission restrictions on delete operations

**Scenario 3 - The Money Question:**
60. Track payment methods separately (cash vs. card)
61. Payment type selection during checkout
62. Separate totals in reports for each payment type
63. Future potential: card terminal integration (out of scope now)

**Scenario 4 - The Growth Opportunity:**
64. Sponsored internally by local business
65. No monetization needed - corporate social responsibility
66. Sustainable as a community service
67. Keeps it truly free without hidden costs

#### Insights from What-If Scenarios:
- Realistic scale expectations (30 users) simplifies architecture
- Payment tracking essential for proper accounting
- Sponsorship model ensures long-term sustainability
- Safety features needed for volunteer mistakes

### Resource Constraints - Practical Reality Check (10 min)

**Description:** Identifying MVP features with minimal resources

#### Ideas Generated:

**The Ultra-Minimal Challenge (2-week MVP):**
